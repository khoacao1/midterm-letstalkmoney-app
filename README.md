Midterm project.

## Getting Started

###This  project show help to understand and know how to use integration test to test UI and performance of the app.
To run the integration test, use the terminal at project repo and run the line:
"flutter drive --driver integration_test/driver.dart --target integration_test/app_test.dart --profile"
this should follow the instructions in the app_test.dart and build a test driver for the app.

I've tested this app on Android and iOS simulator. The simple chat app let user autobatically sign in as anonymous user and can performs some basic function of chat app such as register, login with username and password send text in different group, view and edit user profile, view and edit user log-in info.

After you download the github repo, open the letstalkmoney_app directory in IDE. Set up the simulator then run the command 'flutter run' on the terminal
